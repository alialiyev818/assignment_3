      "description": "In a recent project, I developed a React application modeled after Google Keep. Starting from scratch, I created a 'notes.js' module to export an array of notes, each with a title, content, creation date, and an optional image. I designed a 'Note' component to display these notes, inspired by Google Keep's user-friendly interface. The app features conditional rendering for notes without images and uses destructuring for efficient data handling. Key functionalities include an event listener on each note for user interaction and options to remove or cross out notes. This project highlights my skills in creating intuitive and interactive web applications using React.",

      "description": "In a recent project, I developed a React-based To-Do List app, which served as a practical review of key React concepts. The app involved explaining the nuances between controlled and uncontrolled form elements and demonstrated changing the state of a parent component from child components. I implemented passing callback functions and data from child components to parent components through props. Key features included updating the ToDo List, where clicking on an item either changes its style to indicate completion or removes it from the list. Additionally, I refactored the app by moving the input section to a separate component, ensuring the same functionality while enhancing structure and design. I also incorporated validation to prevent adding empty strings as new ToDo items. This comprehensive project was hosted on GitHub, showcasing my ability to apply React principles in a functional application.",

My tasks included creating a schema with tables for Books, Authors, Orders, and Customers, defining primary and foreign keys, and visually representing this structure with an ER diagram. I wrote SQL statements to create these tables, ensuring they aligned with my schema. Then, I connected to the database through a Java application, implementing proper exception handling. The core of my work involved CRUD operations - inserting new records, retrieving book details, updating book information, and deleting entries. I also managed transactions, particularly when updating book stocks based on customer orders, ensuring data consistency. Lastly, I accessed and displayed database metadata like table structures and key details. This assignment encompassed database design, SQL, and Java programming, honing my skills in creating and managing database applications.",
