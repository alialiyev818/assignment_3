    { id: 2, title: 'The Google Keep App (React)', description: `In a recent project, I developed a React application modeled after Google Keep. Starting from scratch, I created a 'notes.js' module to export an array of notes, each with a title, content, creation date, and an optional image. I designed a 'Note' component to display these notes, inspired by Google Keep's user-friendly interface. The app features conditional rendering for notes without images and uses destructuring for efficient data handling. Key functionalities include an event listener on each note for user interaction and options to remove or cross out notes. This project highlights my skills in creating intuitive and interactive web applications using React.` },
