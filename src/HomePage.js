          <h2>Portfolio Webpage</h2>
          <p>In a recent web development project, I created a personal website, showcasing my CSS skills. I meticulously replicated a template from https://web1-card-assignment.netlify.app/ to build my digital card, featuring links to my GitHub account and projects. Regular updates were pushed to my GitHub repository, maintaining an organized and current codebase. The final version of my website, with compressed source files, was submitted for evaluation, demonstrating my proficiency in web development and adherence to project guidelines.</p>

          <h2>Products Webpage</h2>
          <p>In a recent web development project, I successfully integrated API data from dummyjson.com, showcasing my skills in fetching and error handling with JavaScript. The task involved dynamically displaying product data on a home page, including details like title, price, discount, category, and thumbnail. Enhancing user interaction, I implemented detailed product pages and features like keyword search, category filtering, and pagination for larger data sets. This project highlights my ability to create user-friendly, dynamic web pages with efficient data management.</p>
